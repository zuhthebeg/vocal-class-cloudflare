  We detected a configuration file at C:\Users\zuhth\workspace\vocal-class-cloudflare\wrangler.toml but it is missing the "pages_build_output_dir" field, required by Pages.
  If you would like to use this configuration file to deploy your project, please use "pages_build_output_dir" to specify the directory of static files to upload.
  Ignoring configuration file for now, and proceeding with project deploy.
